# Discord Workshop Update Tracker

This is a simple bot that will periodically check if a steam workshop item has been updated. If it has, it will send a message to a discord channel.

## Setup
Rename the .evn.example file to .env and fill in the values. The bot will not work without this file.
Run docker compose up to start the bot.
